    <h2>Rene Olive</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Rene Olive and currently live in Orlando, FLorida with my husband and 4 year old daughter. 
        We love theme parks, beaches, the natural beauty of Florida and the fun places here to visit and explore. 
        My husband and I got married almost 15 years ago in the Nauvoo Temple. I am originally from Michigan and
        he is originally from Logandale, NV right outside Las Vegas. We also have a fat cat. </p>
    <p>I am taking this course and working on an Applied Technology degree in order to better learn coding and 
        maybe do some web design or UI/UX work. I am not sure exactly where this will take me yet, but I am excited 
    about the opportunities within the field. I homeschool my daughter and am looking to get into a job or freelance
    where I can still give her the time and attention she needs for her studies.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life, but have grown to love the gospel more and appreciate
        it more fully as I've grown. I love the Lord and try to live as an example for my family and the young women 
        who I work with in my calling. I also am meeting a lot of people here in Florida who are not of our faith so 
        it has been fun learning to speak more to my lifestyle in the gospel.</p>
    <p>I have a running list of favorite quotes and scriptures, but one of my absolute favorites is from D&C 78:18-19 and it says,"18 And ye cannot bear all things
        now, nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are
        yours, and the riches of eternity are yours. 19 And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made 
        glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more." I love how this 
        scripture reminds us we can't do everything all at once and we aren't expected to, but we can be cheerful and 
        grateful for all we can do and have been given.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working and learning with you all. Have a great semester!</p>
