      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When was the last time you changed your air filter in your home? When was the last time you cleaned out your gutters? Have you checked your dryer vents recently? 
        Trying to keep up with home maintenance or even daily to-do's can be overwhelming and time can easily slip away from us with our everyday routines. My website is 
        a solution to keep all your home and life maintenance tasks organized so you never have to wake up in the middle of the night and realize you haven't resealed your 
        grout for the past 5 years.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> My audience will likely consist of mothers between the ages of 25-50 who own a home. It is also likely they would be married and have 
        children. I want this site to be usable by the family, though, not just a mom, so it will cater to men and women both. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
