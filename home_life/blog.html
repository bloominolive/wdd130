            <h1>Summer Eats</h1>
            <p>Summer is here which means we are roarin' and ready for watermelon, blueberries, strawberries (actually just give me all the berries...), barbeques, late nights, and more! 
                How can you keep your home clean and organized while still enjoying the warmth of the season? Let's dig in!
                Remember that delicious food I mentioned earlier? Food is always a great place to start! What is the first thing you do when you get your produce home from the store?
                Do you shove it into the bowels of the crisper hoping some desperate child will happen upon it and in some way be compelled to choose this delectable, natural treat over 
                a prepackaged pouch of salt and carbs? Maybe... it's okay. We've all been there. The best secret tip I can give you for making fruits and veggies an easier option for the whole
                family is to WASH THEM RIGHT AWAY! It's easy to rationalize not doing it. You get home from the store, you're busy, kids have already broken something and the LAST thing you want to 
                worry about is cleaning fruits and veggies. "I'll just wait until we're ready to eat them", you tell yourself. But we all know about the package of grapes that gets stuck in the 
                back of the crisper for a month because the bag of chips was easier to grab. If you want to SAVE MONEY and SAVE TIME- wash that produce right away when you get home! It doesn't 
                to be time consuming. The best strategy is to pull all your produce out BEFORE you put away anything else. Fill your sink with water, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and a drop of 
                dish soap (I like Dawn but you can use whatever). Throw your produce in (all of it except greens so think berries, citrus, etc.) and let it soak. By the time you're done putting away
                the rest of your groceries, all your healthy snacks will be ready to rinse and dry. Simply put them on a paper towel or dish drying mat for a few minutes and then sort them into EASY TO GRAB 
                baggies that anyone will be happy to take over a bag of chips. Tips for bagging- put a paper towel (or two) in the bag to absorb extra moisture. You may need to change it out every day or two 
                if it gets too moist. Another tip is to keep them visible in the fridge or on the counter- don't hide it all in the back! You can also make a sign to put on the pantry (or wherever the chips are)
                saying something like, "Check the fridge for snacks!" to get in the habit of checking for healthy snacks before prepackaged foods.</p>
                <h4>Here is a list of produce to wash right when you get it home:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Bananas (yes, really!)</li>
                <li>Avocados</li>
                <li>Peppers</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Celery</li>
                <li>Grapes</li>
                <li>Citrus (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, etc.)</li>
                <li>Cucumber</li>
                <li>Mangoes</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Peaches</li>
                <li>Apricots</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And more! It's easy to throw a whole batch together in the sink and separate them out once they're clean into baggies to easily grab for snacks or recipes. We all know there are a lot of pesticides
                presesnt on most of our produce. If you buy organic, there's likely been bugs or animals around the food. Either way, it's best to wash all produce before eating. Make your life easier by taking a few minutes
                to clean your food so everyone can enjoy the benefits of healthier food in your home. Another bonus is that, by bagging and cleaning it all, you keep your fridge cleaner and food is rotated more often! You'll 
                be so excited to have food that is fresh and a kitchen that's cleaner. Enjoy!
