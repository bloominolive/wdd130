                <li>Check Inventory- what supplies do you have and what do you need?</li>
                <li>Check window screens for tears and stability. It's summer! Open the windows and get some sun!</li>
                <li>Use white vinegar to wipe down your fridge shelves and use paper towel or dish drying mats for crispers.</li>

            <p>Summer is here which means we are roarin' and ready for watermelon, blueberries, strawberries (actually just give me all the berries...), barbeques, late nights, and more! 
                How can you keep your home clean and organized while still enjoying the warmth of the season? Let's dig in!
                Remember that delicious food I mentioned earlier? Food is always a great place to start! What is the first thing you do when you get your produce home from the store?
                Do you shove it into the bowels of the crisper hoping some desperate child will happen upon it and in some way be compelled to choose this delectable, natural treat over 
                a prepackaged pouch of salt and carbs? Maybe... it's okay. We've all been there. The best secret tip I can give you for making fruits and veggies an easier option for the whole
                family is to WASH THEM RIGHT AWAY! It's easy to rationalize not doing it. You get home from the store, you're busy, kids have already broken something and the LAST thing you want to 
                worry about is cleaning fruits and veggies. "I'll just wait until we're ready to eat them", you tell yourself. But we all know about the package of grapes that gets stuck in the 
                back of the crisper for a month because the bag of chips was easier to grab... </p>
