    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to increase sales of rafting tours on Moose river while also spreading awareness of local nature and preservation.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience will be families with kids from age 8 and up who are looking for an adventure with an element of education and awareness of our local area. The parents are likely middle to upper middle class workers who
        enjoy taking vacations in the summer together. The parents' ages range from mid 30's to mid 50's. They are interested in nature, camping, adventure, hiking, survival. They want an experience with a guide who can 
        safely lead them and their families on an exciting tour that also enlightens them and helps them feel closer and more in tune with the world around them. They have a need for time away from the every day hustle and
        bustle of busy family life to spend time somewhere untouched by the chaos of life to recenter theirs. My audience will usually access my site on a mobile device, though they may look on a desktop or laptop occasionally
        if they are viewing it at work or with the family at home.
